# Prototyping a new version of ObjcUnit

I'm experimenting with a new version of ObjcUnit,
a unit test framwork for Objective-C
that I wrote back in 2001/2002
together with my friend and co-worker Peter Lindberg.
ObjcUnit was an adaption
(almost a direct translation)
of jUnit to Objective-C.

I haven't touched ObjcUnit in years.
When testing on the mac today
I usually go with OCUnit/SenTestingKit
because it's bundled with the dev tools,
but I often get frustrated with the whole setup.
Testing code on the mac is cumbersome.

I have a few ideas on how to improve the situation.
Well, I have a few ideas on *how to do things differently*.
Perhaps when realized,
they will also turn out to improve the state of testing on the mac.
We'll see.
